            <h3>Personal Statement</h3>
            <p>Education is the most potent propeller for a better world. Every single teacher is using their full power to push it. Children are our future. My philosophy of education is that every child is unique thus must have a differentiated instructional environment for them to learn. The learning environment should be positive, supportive and collaborative for them to meet their full potential. In my classroom, I will help my students to identify and thoroughly understand their potential by adapting differentiated teaching strategies and motivating their learning spontaneity.</p>
